This map layer contains the shallowest principal aquifers of the
conterminous United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
Islands, portrayed as polygons.  The map layer was developed as part of
the effort to produce the maps published at 1:2,500,000 in the printed
series "Ground Water Atlas of the United States".  The published maps
contain base and cultural features not included in these data.  This is a
replacement for the July 1998 map layer called Principal Aquifers of the
48 Conterminous United States.
</abstract><purpose>
These data are intended for use in publications, at a scale of 1:2,500,000
or smaller.  Due to the small scale, the primary intended use is for
regional and national data display and analysis, rather than specific
local data analysis.
</purpose><supplinf>
The Ground Water Atlas of the United States (GWA) chapters include
additional information that may be relevant to the use of this map layer,
such as maps of alluvial and glacial aquifers that overlie the aquifers in
this map layer, as well as other information described below.

The areal extent of the aquifers, as shown in this map layer, represents
the area in which a named aquifer is the shallowest of the principal
aquifers.  These aquifer areas are not necessarily the only areas in which
groundwater can be withdrawn, for two reasons:  1) The aquifers shown may
have a larger areal extent than is represented here.  The boundaries in
this map layer generally represent an interpretation of the surface
location (outcrop), or near-surface location (shallow subcrop) of the
uppermost principal aquifer for the area.  An aquifer may extend beyond
the area shown, but be overlain by one or more other aquifers, and (or)
low-permeability material.  2) There may be areas of water-bearing
surficial material not shown in this map layer.  Major alluvial aquifers
that occur along main watercourses are not shown.  Significant
unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers, that are not indicated in this
map layer but are important sources of water, may occur locally in
glaciated regions.  The user of this map layer is advised that to get
complete information regarding areas that serve as sources of water, more
information about surficial aquifers needs to be obtained, particularly in
glaciated areas.

This map layer was constructed by combining data created for or from the
regional GWA chapters.  Minor aquifers that are important local sources of
water were mapped in some regions, so the regional maps in the GWA may
show more detail than this map layer.  The data were reviewed, adjusted,
and published based on new information provided by national, State, and
local scientists.  The juxtaposition of regionally mapped aquifers has led
to some instances where an aquifer outcrop or shallow subcrop is bounded
by a State line.  This is a result of the regional mapping and national
categorization methods used and is not meant to imply a hydrogeologic
change coincident with a State boundary.

The aquifer outcrop and shallow subcrop boundaries represent broad,
regional categories and should not be interpreted as site-specific.
Comments regarding the names of aquifers or the hydrogeologic
interpretation of the aquifers can be directed to the U.S. Geological
Survey, Water Resources Division, Office of Groundwater,
ogw_webmaster@usgs.gov.

This map layer was used as part of the effort to publish a 1:5,000,000-
scale 'Principal Aquifers' map in the National Atlas of the United States
of America series of printed maps.  The printed map can be considered  a
representation of this map layer with the exceptions of: the smaller
scale, slight differences in the coastline due to generalization, base and
cultural information, and delineation of the glacial-deposit area.

These data were developed in conjunction with the publication of the GWA.
For documentation purposes, areas are referred to by their corresponding
GWA chapter letter, or by State.  This list shows the relationship between
State names and GWA chapters:

of the GWA chapter regions, as well as more information about the GWA.

It may be helpful to refer to the printed GWA chapters when using the
Data, however, there are significant differences between this national
map layer and the printed chapters.  Because the GWA regional chapters
were written by different authors, there were areas of different
interpretations and category delineations, aquifer names, etc., that
became apparent when combining the regions.

The following listings show the differences between aquifer names in the
GWA chapters and the aq_name and aq_code used in this map layer.  See the
Entity and Attribute Information section for definitions of the data

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets

A map layer showing the areal extent of sand and gravel aquifers of
alluvial and glacial origin north of the line of Quaternary continental
glaciation is included in the online, interactive National Atlas of the
United States.  This map layer ends at the southern limit of
glaciation in the United States; areas north of the limit line contain
significant sand and gravel glacial deposits that are important sources of
water for local areas.

For additional information on principal aquifers, please see the Aquifer
Basics page at &lt;http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/aquiferbasics/&gt;.

The final data are being served to the public in the following formats:
Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS), Arc/INFO Export, or ArcView
Shapefile.

February 2015 Addendum: These files were downloaded from the 
National Atlas (nationalatlas.gov) on September 29, 2014, by 
the USGS Water Mission Area Office of Groundwater. The National 
Atlas was discontinued and removed from service at the end of 
September 2014.

For information about how the files were originally generated, 
refer to this metadata file. No additional information is 
available; the original USGS office that generated the maps 
(Cartography and Publishing Programs) no longer exists. No 
updates or changes were made to the original files downloaded 
from the National Atlas other than to update the metadata to 
reflect the history of the files and to update the relevant 
contact information.

The USGS Office of Groundwater is making these files available 
online on its web site (http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/) as of 
March 2014 to continue the availability of these high-value, 
frequently requested USGS data.

Aquifer data for the conterminous United States.
</srccontr></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>
Aquifer outcrop line work for each GWA chapter was compiled on mylar at
a scale of 1:2,000,000, and reduced to 1:2,500,000 for further
production work.  For chapters HA 730-G, -H, and -J, the outcrop lines
were scribed at a line width of 0.006 inch.  Film positives made from
the scribed materials were scanned on a drum scanner, vectorized, and
converted to Arc/INFO coverages.  For chapters HA 730-B, -C, -D, -E, -F,
-I, -K, -L, and -M, the aquifer compilation was either hand digitized,
and (or) scanned on a drum scanner, vectorized and converted to Arc/INFO
coverages.  The data were then checked, cleaned up, and attribute
creation was done.

The Arc/INFO coverages were plotted and checked against the source
compilations.  Polygons were attributed using Arcedit.  The coverages
for GWA chapters HA 730-B, -C, -D, -E, -F, -I, -K, -L, and -M were used
to generate output files that were imported into Adobe Illustrator
for map publication.  Each completed map, at a scale of 1:2,500,000, was
reviewed for content and accuracy by the chapter lead cartographer,
Water Resources Discipline Geohydrologic Map Editor, and chapter author.

Individual chapter coverages were appended into one continuous coverage.
Arcedit was used for edgematching and to remove duplicate labels.  No
DISSOLVE was done on the coverage; an equivalent of a DISSOLVE was done
manually in Arcedit in conjunction with attribute checking, by removing
arcs that divided adjacent polygons with the same attributes.  Several
iterations of editing were performed.  These mostly involved ensuring
all polygons had labels and aquifer information and ensuring polygons

Plots of the national aquifers file were made at 1:2,500,000, covering
the areas of the regional GWA chapters.  Each plot was compared to the
printed GWA chapter aquifer maps.  Where applicable (chapters HA 730-B,
-C, -D, -E, -F, -I, -K, - L, and -M), an Adobe Illustrator file of the
coverage data was compared on-screen with the Illustrator file used to
print the published map.  Discrepancies between the coverage file and
print file were noted, and the coverage updated to match the published
map.  Where a line appeared to shift noticeably (approximately 1/8 inch
at a scale of 1:2,500,000) across the boundary of two adjacent GWA
chapter regions, the line was adjusted for a smoother appearance.  The
adjustments may have been made on one or both sides of the region
boundary, depending on a cartographic assessment of the instance.

Coastline Location

The 1:2,500,000 principal aquifer maps in the Ground Water Atlas
publications used a coastline and international boundary, derived either
from the map separates from the National Atlas of the United States of
America (published 1970), or from the Digital Line Graph (DLG) data
created from the 1970 National Atlas.  GWA chapters HA 730-G, -J, and -H
used coastline and boundary filmwork  photo-mechanically reduced from
the 1:2,000,000 National Atlas map separates.  The remaining chapters
used coastline and boundary data from the DLG's.  A revision of the DLG
data took place in 1997, after the creation of the chapter aquifer map
data.

After the edgematching, a decision was made to replace the coast and
international boundary of this national-level aquifer data with one
derived from a newer version of 1997 DLG data.  State boundary data from
the National Atlas was used to provide the coastline and two aquifer
boundaries that coincide with State lines.

The existing outline (coastline and international boundary line) was
removed, the new outline added to the coverage, and the remaining
aquifer contact lines snapped to the new outline.  The coverage was re-
cleaned, data categories checked onscreen and with plots, and corrected.
Line and labeling corrections, such as undershoots, overshoots, and
improper labels were corrected in Arcedit.

There are some slight locational differences between this map layer and
the printed GWA chapters.  For example, there are  several small
differences in the number of small islands in coastal areas and the
categorization of these small islands was assigned to either the nearby
principal aquifer category or as Not a principal aquifer, depending on
the location and categorization of similar small islands in the printed
GWA chapters.  There are other differences in the categorization of some
land/shoreline-related features. For example, an area symbolized as a
bay in a GWA chapter may be land in this map layer.

Western Montana

During the review of a printed map made from this national-level aquifer
data, the compiler, James A. Miller, requested a change in the
representation of aquifers in western Montana.  The area affected is in
the following counties: Lincoln, Flathead, Sanders, Lake, Mineral,
Missoula, Powell, Ravalli, Granite, Lewis and Clark, Deer Lodge, Silver
Bow, Jefferson,  Broadwater, Gallatin, Beavershead, and Madison.  These
areas fall under the Northern Rocky Mountain Intermontane Basins
Regional Aquifer Systems Analysis (RASA).  With one exception, the
aquifers, as shown in GWA chapter I, figure 7 in the listed counties
were removed and replaced with unconsolidated-deposit areas as shown in
GWA chapter HA 730-I, figure 6.  The exception is an area in northern
Flathead county, listed as an Upper Tertiary aquifer in GWA chapter I,
figure 7, that was retained as an area but reclassified as a Lower
Tertiary aquifer.

Aquifer data was taken from digital files created in Adobe Illustrator
for Ground Water Atlas chapter HA 730-N of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the
U.S. Virgin Islands.  Where polygons ended at the shoreline, National
Atlas State boundaries were used.  The final Illustrator file was
exported into a DXF file.  The DXF file was converted to a coverage.
Using the TRANSFORM command, the coverage containing the aquifer lines
was rubber-sheeted to the coverage containing registration tics, and was
then projected from geographic coordinates to Albers Equal-Area Conic
projection for verification purposes.  The aquifer coverage was cleaned,
the topology was built, and labels were added.  Attributes were added as
necessary.

The Principal Aquifers map published in 1998 was reviewed and modified,
resulting in 57 aquifers, 36 of which were the same geographically as in
the 1998 publication.  Aquifers were aggregated, divided, renamed and
updated from more recent publications, using a variety of techniques,
which include scanning, importing unpublished digital data and paper
compilation at 1:2,500,000 scale.  The updated Adobe Illustrator aquifer
data was exported into a DXF file.  The DXF file was converted to a
coverage.  Using the TRANSFORM command, the coverage containing the
